# Customers
*Gate dashboard and data access with hierarchical relationships among your customers.*

Customers help you gate access to your data and dashboards. Customers can be organized into a hierarchy, which allows you to gate access to your data and dashboards at any level of the hierarchy. For example, you can grant access to a dashboard to an organization or specific users within that organization (a two tier hierarchy).

Customers in Cue contain the following information:
```ts
level: "customer" | "user" // This helps create multi-tier hierarchies. By default, we support two tiers: customer and user, but more can be added if needed.
parentId?: string // The id of the parent customer. If this is null, then this customer is a root customer.
name: string // The name of the customer.
id: string // The ID of the customer - this is either passed in on customer creation or generated by Cue.
organizationId: string // The ID of the Cue organization that this customer belongs to
```

When creating a dashboard, customer information is exposed as a variable that can be used to filter datasets and graph values for specific data - allowing you to protect your data and dashboards. A customer ID is passed in as a variable to your dashboard, which can be used to filter datasets and graph values for specific data.
