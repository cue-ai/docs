# Customer Analytics

One of our core beliefs is that customer analytics should be treated the same as internal analytics.

The Cue Customer Analytics platform allows you to track and analyze your customers' behavior using event-based analytics, just like you would with your internal analytics, and seamlessly integrate it into the rest of your analytics stack (embedded dashboards, API endpoints, etc).

This means for companies that are tracking real-time data for their customers - like page views for an affiliate link sharing company - can drop in a line of code to collect an event for a page view and ship customer-facing dashboards in minutes all within Cue.

## How it works

Customer analytics is built on top of a Clickhouse OLAP database - a fast, columnar database that is optimized for analytics workloads. Cue provides a simple API to send events to Clickhouse, and the Clickhouse database can be added as a data source to to build dashboards or insight feeds.
