# Getting Started

*If you'd like to use customer analytics, contact the Cue team*

We offer both API endpoints and a lightweight Javascript SDK to help you get started.

## Installation

## Javascript SDK

[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cue-ai/analytics-client-web)

###  Installation

```
yarn add @cue-ai/analytics-client-web
```

Once installed, create an SDK client

```ts
import { createClient } from '@cue-ai/analytics-client-web';

export const analyticsClient = createClient({
  url, // Defaults to https://app.trycue.ai/api
  apiKey, // Your API Key
  organizationId, // Your organization ID
})
```

After creating a client, you'll want to first identify the current user:

```ts
// Identify a user
analyticsClient.identify(customerId: string)
```

This will scope events to a specific [customer](/customers) in Cue.

Then you can track an analytics event:

```ts
// Track an event
analyticsClient.track(eventName: string, properties: Record<string, any>)
```
