# Embedding

After creating dashboards, there are three ways to embed them in your application

## 1. React Components

Embedding dashboards in your React application is the recommended way to embed dashboards. It is the most flexible and customizable way to embed dashboards.

The `@cue-ai/embedded` package provides a set of React components that can be used to embed dashboards in your React application.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @cue-ai/embedded
```

### Usage

```jsx
import { EmbeddedProvider, EmbeddedDashboardProvider, EmbeddedItemsRenderer  } from '@cue-ai/embedded';

<EmbeddedProvider organizationId="organizationId">
  <main className="max-w-[1400px] mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    <div className="py-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Embedded</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
        This is a demo of the embedded editor.
      </p>
    </div>
    <EmbeddedDashboardProvider
      dashboardId="dashboardId"
      customerId="customerId"
    >
      <EmbeddedItemsRenderer />
    </EmbeddedDashboardProvider>
  </main>
</EmbeddedProvider>
```

Swap out the `organizationId`, `dashboardId` and `customerId` with your own values.

## 2. iFrame

The iFrame method is the easiest way to embed dashboards. It is the least flexible and customizable way to embed dashboards.

```
<iframe
  src="https://app.trycue.ai/customer-dashboard/{dashboardId}?customer-id={customerId}"
/>
```

Swap out the `dashboardId` and `customerId` with your own values.

## 3. Customer Portal

The customer portal is a pre-built React application where your customers can access and configure their Cue dashboards.

This option is available by request only.
